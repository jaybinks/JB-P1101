# JB-P1101

Idea, Code and Schematic based on 
https://www.espthings.io/index.php/2023/09/02/esphome-panasonic-climate-interface/ and 
https://github.com/DomiStyle/esphome-panasonic-ac/

I have a great dislike for dupont cables, and I have a number of excess naked ESP32 wroom 32 (not dev boards).
So id rather design a custom board, than rely on a devboard.
